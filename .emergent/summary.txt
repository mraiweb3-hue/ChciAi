**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to overhaul their website, , turning it into a professional AI Transformation Agency. The project started with simple UI tweaks and evolved into a comprehensive redesign and feature implementation based on a series of detailed user prompts.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (based on the latest user requests):**
1.  **Core Business Model:** The agency is Chci AI. Their internal assistant is Clawix. The product they sell to clients is safe set up, download the OpenClaw, an AI assistant with hands that clients can rename and customize.
2.  **Website Redesign:**
    *   **Aesthetics:** Modern, futuristic AI design with glassmorphism, gradient effects, and a dark/light mode.
    *   **Logo:** A 3D, rotating Chci AI logo in the top-left of the navigation bar.
    *   **Hero Section:** Clearly present the OpenClaw as open source.
3.  **Key Features:**
    *   **Collaboration Process Section:** A 7-step visual guide explaining how the agency works with clients.
    *   **Security Section:** A section to build trust, highlighting GDPR, encryption, etc.
    *   **Clawix Callback Form:** A form for users to request a call from the Clawix assistant. It should collect name, phone, language, and preferred call time.
    *   **Clawix Chatbot:** An interactive chatbot in the bottom-right corner to act as a sales/qualification agent, guiding users to the right service offering.
4.  **Future-State (Placeholder/Planned):**
    *   **Client Onboarding Dashboard ():** A private area for clients to track their OpenClaw setup.
    *   **Academy ():** A members-only section with training materials.
    *   **Backend-driven Content:** Page content should be dynamically loaded from a MongoDB collection.
    *   **SaaS Architecture:** The project should be structured to eventually support a multi-tenant SaaS model.
5.  **Technical Stack:** React (with Craco), FastAPI, MongoDB.
6.  **CI/CD:** A GitHub Actions workflow for deployment that is currently broken.

**User's preferred language**: Czech. The next agent MUST respond in Czech only.

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application (React frontend, FastAPI backend) that has undergone a significant redesign. Key features like the 3D logo, dark/light mode, the 7-step process section, the security section, the Clawix callback form, and the Clawix chatbot widget are implemented on the frontend. The backend has been updated with an endpoint to handle callback form submissions. Placeholder pages for  and  have been created. The agent has successfully differentiated the branding between the internal assistant Clawix and the client product OpenClaw.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The user reported a failing GitHub Actions deployment workflow and provided a screenshot. The agent correctly diagnosed two problems:
    1.  The cache step in the workflow incorrectly references  (for npm) instead of  (which the project uses).
    2.  The workflow uses Node.js v22, which is incompatible with the project's dependency  that requires Node.js .
*   **Status:** NOT STARTED
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** This is a CI/CD workflow issue. The agent needs to edit the relevant  file. Testing cannot be done by the agent directly. The agent must push the fix and inform the user that the verification will happen on the next commit when the GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically.
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1:** Fix the failing GitHub Actions deployment workflow (P0)

**Issues Detail:**
*   **Issue 1:**
    *   **Attempted fixes:** None. The issue was just diagnosed.
    *   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Use  to locate the correct workflow YAML file.
        2.  View the file to confirm the identified problems.
        3.  Use  to change the Node.js version in the  step to a compatible version (e.g., ).
        4.  Use  to change the cache path key from  to .
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will repair the continuous deployment pipeline, allowing changes to be automatically deployed.
    *   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    *   **Is recurring issue?** N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Neither. The fix is for the CI/CD pipeline. The user must verify the fix by checking the status of the workflow run on GitHub after the fix is committed.
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** No.

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P1 - Implement Backend-Driven Content:** Refactor the frontend components (, , etc.) to fetch text content dynamically from a new  collection in MongoDB, as requested by the user. This will involve creating a new backend endpoint to serve this content.
    *   **P1 - Integrate SMS Notifications:** For the Clawix callback form, integrate an SMS service (e.g., Twilio) to send a confirmation to the user, with options to cancel or reschedule the call. This requires a new backend endpoint and integration.
    *   **P2 - Fully Implement Client Onboarding Dashboard:** Build out the UI and backend logic for the  page. This includes showing installation status, a checklist, and training materials.
    *   **P2 - Implement Backend SEO Endpoint:** Create the  endpoint in  to dynamically generate JSON-LD schema for , , and .

*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **Build Academy/Membership Section:** Develop the full functionality for the  page, including user authentication, video modules, resource downloads, and progress tracking.
    *   **Evolve to Multi-Tenant SaaS:** Refactor the architecture to support a full multi-tenant SaaS model with isolated instances and databases.
    *   **Build Admin Dashboard:** Create an administrative interface for managing leads, clients, and content.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Craco
*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **3D/Animations:** React Three Fiber, Drei, Framer Motion, GSAP
*   **State Management:** React Context API

**key DB schema**
*   **callback_requests:**  (Implemented)
*   **leads:** Schema for qualified leads from the chatbot. (Requested, Not Implemented)
*   **content_sections:**  (Requested, Not Implemented)
*   **users:** (Existing)
*   **chatbot_instances:** (Existing)

**changes in tech stack**
The following libraries were added to support the redesign and new features:
*   , ,  for 3D rendering.
*    for UI animations.
*    for scroll-based animations.
*    for managing the document head (SEO).

**All files of reference**
*   **File to Fix:** A workflow file, likely located in , is causing the deployment error.
*   **Key Modified Files:**
    *   : Main page, heavily modified to include all new components and structure.
    *   : Modified to add the  endpoint.
    *   : Modified to include new routes for placeholder pages.
*   **Key New Files:**
    *   : The 3D rotating logo in the navbar.
    *   : The lead capture form.
    *   : The interactive chatbot.
    *   : The 7-step process visual.
    *   : Placeholder for client dashboard.
    *   : Placeholder for the training academy.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The frontend components currently have hardcoded text content. This should be refactored to fetch content from the backend based on the user's request for a DB-driven content system ( collection).

**key api endpoints**
*   : Saves a new callback request from the contact form.
*   (Existing auth endpoints like , )

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   **Priority 1 is fixing the CI/CD workflow.** The application code is likely fine, but the deployment process is broken. The fix involves editing a  file in the  directory, not application code.
*   The distinction between **Clawix** (the agency's internal AI assistant) and **OpenClaw** (the product sold to clients) is fundamental to the user's business logic. All new development must respect this distinction.
*   The user's detailed prompts (especially messages 173 and 123) should be treated as the primary source of truth for product requirements.
